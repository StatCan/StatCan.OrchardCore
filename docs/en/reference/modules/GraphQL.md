# Queries.GraphQL (`StatCan.OrchardCore.Queries.GraphQL`)

This module adds the GraphQL query type to Orchard's Query feature.
This allows a site administrator to use the GraphQL syntax with queries.


Please refer to the [Queries](https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/dev/docs/reference/modules/Queries/#liquid-templates) documentation for details on how to use this query in your templates.

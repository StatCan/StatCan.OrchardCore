# Testing

We use the Cypress JS testing framework to run E2E tests for this application.

## Useful commands

From the `/test` folder in this solution, you can run the following commands to simplify testing the application.

- `npm run host` hosts a version of OC running in production mode (faster).
- `npm run build` builds the application.
- `npm run test` hosts the site then runs cypress tests.
- `npm run cypress` opens cypress dashboard.
- `npm run cypress:run` runs the cypress tests in the console. Assumes a pre-running site instance.
